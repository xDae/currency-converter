## About the assignment
# InterviewAssignmentFrontendReact
Your assignment is to create a frontend for a currency converter (see the photo in the design folder).

1. The User inputs a monetary amount (amount and currency) and selects into which currency to convert. Supported currencies for input and output are EUR, USD, YEN and CHF.

2. At the press of a button, the website will show the converted amount to the user. Implement the conversion logic in your app by usign todays exchange rates.

3. The app has a history component where all the previous transactions are stored and displayed. Impement this component.

You have 75 minutes to work on the assignment. Please take these hints into consideration:

- We are interested in seeing your working and thinking process. Articulating your thoughts will improve your chances.
- If you have questions regarding the assignment, don't hesitate to ask your interviewer. You can also use them to validate your thinking.
- You are required to implement the essential functionality, but you are free to use external dependecies as utilities for testing.
- Feel free to use the power of the internet to look things up.



## React CLI stuff
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
